Tool Used: Excel

Methodology:
 1. Data Collection and Recording:
   - Raw data from microbial tests and biochemical assays were recorded meticulously.
   - Antimicrobial susceptibility results, including inhibitory zone diameters (IZD), were documented.

 2. Data Cleaning:
   - The data was imported into Excel.
   - Missing values and outliers were identified and handled appropriately.
   - Data was validated for accuracy and consistency.

 3. Descriptive Analysis:
   - Frequency Distribution: Calculated the frequency of different microorganisms isolated.
   - Central Tendency:Computed mean and mode for various biochemical test results.
 

 4. Statistical Analysis:
   - Chi-Square Test: Assessed the relationship between categorical variables (e.g., types of microorganisms and sample sources).
   - Correlation Analysis: Evaluated relationships between biochemical test results and antimicrobial susceptibility.

 5. Inferential Analysis:
   - Hypothesis Testing: Conducted tests to infer population parameters based on sample data.

    6. Visualization:
   - Created graphs and charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line charts) to visualize data  distributions and relationships.
   - Used pivot tables for dynamic data summarization and analysis.

 7. Interpretation and Reporting:
   - Summarized findings in a comprehensive report, highlighting key insights from the analysis.
   - Discussed implications of microbial presence and resistance patterns for clinical practice.

 8.Quality Assurance:
   - Ensured reproducibility by documenting each step of the analysis process.
   - Cross-checked results for consistency and reliability.
